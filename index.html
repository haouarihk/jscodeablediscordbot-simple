    <h1>When life gives you lemons...</h1>
    <p>
      ...don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't
      want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?! Demand to see
      life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave
      Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your
      house down! With the lemons! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a
      combustible lemon that burns your house down!
